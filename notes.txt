Step 1:
If someone enters page: enter name
Create object of class (to make): player IF name doesn't exist in list
if name already exists then: re-assign player to socket id (or something)
create reset option for this list
TODO: define two states that indicate whether the game has begun or not
# problem: what if game is already going? if players refreshes and name doesn't match: nothing happens?

Step 2:
Create game class, make rounds and voting system
Create gamestate array containing roundnumber, vote count etc.
Create class function in game class that updates player array
